# Database:
Inside the Database directory, contains the Access Points of some floors of the central building of the campus in Ã‰vry - France.

# Code: 
Inside the code directory, the code is split in a panic button conceived on Android Studio (zip file Button), responsible to get user's information related to the current wifi connection, and a proxy server in Python (tcp_proxy.py) that loads the database and it contains the KNN algorithm to predict the user's location.

# Primary Results:
More than 60% of accuracy in the predicition, considering a test of 170 alert messages in 3 buildings with 4 floors.
